<h1 class="title">Library programme</h1>


<p>
The School-based Library Programme is a key part of Akshara’s
approach, as we believe that books and reading impact children’s
learning outcomes by helping them become better readers. The Programme
has set up nearly 400 libraries in the 1417 Government Primary Schools
in Bangalore Urban district covering a total of 215,000 children.
Every child in every government primary school (Classes 2-7 ) in
Bangalore has access to library facilities.

<p>
The Library Programme aims to make every child in every government
primary school a Library member and bring in methodologies to ensure
that they are reading well. To this end, the goals of the Programme
are:
</p>
<p>
<a href="#sec-1"class="align-right frame"><img src="/images/lib-manuals.jpg"/></a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Provide support to institutionalize, structure, co-ordinate and
organize sustainable library services for every child in all
government primary schools in Bangalore – all 215,000 children from
grades 2-7 should have regular access to library facilities.
</li>
<li>
Provide good and strong “curriculum” (Books, Computers, Innovative
Learning activities) to these Libraries.
</li>
<li>
Create tools to measure impact of efforts – both process data and
child assessment data gathered as part of our Research efforts, will
be collected and analysed.
</li>
<li>
Create the library network by leveraging existing facilities and
institutions where possible, and, facilitate additional facilities
where they do not exist. We will work with the state Education
Department and over time with the Department of Public Libraries in
the state.
</li>
<li>
Transition and hand over the libraries to the Education Department
who can sustain this beyond the grant period.
</li>
<li>
To make the results of the Programme available in the public domain
at the KLP website (<a href="http://www.karnatakalearningpartnership.org">http://www.karnatakalearningpartnership.org</a>)
</li>
<li>
To document the efforts to enable replication in other parts of the
state and indeed in other states.
</li>
<li>
To create a knowledge base and expertise for libraries within
Akshara to assist in replication across the state and the country.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
All books in the Library are graded using a heuristic procedure
defined by the Hippocampus Reading Foundation, called "GROW
BY". According to this procedure, books are graded into 6 bins or
levels based on the number of sentences per page. Each book receives a
coloured sticker on its spine to indicate the level. The scheme is as
given below:
</p>
<p>
<a href="#sec-2.1"class="align-left frame"><img src="/images/lib-2.jpg"/></a>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption></caption>
<colgroup><col align="left" /><col align="left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr><td>0 to 2 sentences per page</td><td>G level ( Green sticker)</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 to 4 sentences per page</td><td>R level ( Red sticker)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4 to 6 sentences per page</td><td>O level ( Orange sticker)</td></tr>
<tr><td>7 to 8 sentences per page</td><td>W level ( White sticker)</td></tr>
<tr><td>9 to 10 sentences per page</td><td>B level ( Blue sticker)</td></tr>
<tr><td>More than 10 sentences per page</td><td>Y level ( Yellow sticker)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
As a child reads books in the Library, it is expected to read simple
books at the start (G or R level books). As its reading skill
improves, the child reads more complex books (O, W, B and Y books).

<p>
The children participate in a variety of activities in the
Libraries. Loud Reading, Story Telling, Book based Projects are part
of the game. We also run special immersive activities in the Libraries
that reinforce aspects of their own classroom curriculum ( Minimum
Learning Levels), but isong the story books in the Library.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.3">


<p>
To measure the results of the program using quantifiable indicators,
Akshara has partnered with Assistant Professor Leigh Linden of the
Columbia University Department of Economics to implement a large-scale
3-year longitudinal randomized evaluation of the library program. The
primary purpose of the research endeavor is to investigate the effects
of providing children with access to reading material either through
access to an Akshara sponsored library facility, teacher membership to
a nearby Akshara library, or the direct monthly receipt of books.
</p>
<p>
The research methodology was designed by Prof. Leigh Linden's team
after studying the survey results and the past performance results of
the KLP Reading programme.
</p>
<p>
About 400 schools were selected randomly to particpate in the study
and these were broken up into two sets of 200 schools, representing
Treatment and Control groups.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.4">


<p>
As part of the Research we made a few assessments of the children's
learnng outfomes., in the selected 400 schools.
</p>
<p>
<a href="#sec-2.4"class="align-left frame"><img src="/images/lib-1.jpg"/></a>
</p>
<p>
The baseline assessment, conducted before the Libraries were switched
on, consisted of separate language and math tests for the study sample
of students in grades 3-5. Students in grades 4-5 received the exact
same tests whereas students in grade 3 received a slightly abbreviated
language test but the same exact math test. There were Urdu and
Kannada versions that were administered in Urdu and Kannada medium
schools respectively.
</p>
<p>
The Post test, conducted on the same set of children used the
classroom competencies (MLLs) to check if the children in the
Treatment Group were ahead of those in the Control Group.
