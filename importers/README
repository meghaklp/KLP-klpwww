Setup
=====

There are two DB creation scripts: klpwww.sh and
klp-coord.sh. klp-coord.sh should be called first as klpwww creates a
dblink and creates some remote views (vw_*) from klp-coord.

Users
=====

There are 2 Postgres users: klp and web. klp is the owner of the
abovementioned two scripts. web is the user that the webapp uses to
query the DB. web has only select privilege on the table.

Security
========

For the time being, the DB user and password are hardcoded in
Utility.KLPDB. When this moves to a configuration file, update this
file.
